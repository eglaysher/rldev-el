## rldev-el ##

Two emacs major modes used to make using
[`rldev`](http://dev.haeleth.net/rldev.shtml) easier:

 * kepago-mode is a simple, syntax highlighting major mode for disassembled
   SEEN.TXT files and should be generally usefull for anyone translating a
   RealLive game.

 * kfn-mode is designed to font-lock [one specific
   file](http://svn.haeleth.net/pub/rldev/lib/reallive.kfn). This is an
   internal compiler file to Haeleth's rldev suite and is the mapping between
   human readable function names like `SetFontColor` (and their type
   signatures) and the bytecode representation `<0:003:00100, 2>`.
